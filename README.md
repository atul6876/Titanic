Binary Classfication Kaggle Problem meant for newcomers into the field to practice their skills in Data Cleansing, Feature Engineering, builidng ML models, and analyzing the performance of the models.
I have posted this repository to have a set of jupyter notebooks having the code to do all of the necessry steps that I mentioned above, as well as visualizations and different machine learning models includeing Naive Bayes Classifiers, Random Forest Classifiers, Logistic Regression Classifers (although it won't perform well, owing to the fact that the decision boundary for classificaion was not a linear hyperplane).
